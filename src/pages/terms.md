        Order Verification or SOW. Customer will pay Strategic Defense
        Corporation’s invoices within thirty (30) days following the
        date of invoice (“Due Date”).

    3.  Late Payment. If Customer does not pay any amounts due within

        per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable
        legislation, whichever is less, determined and compounded daily
        from the Due Date until the date paid. Strategic Defense
        Corporation reserves the right to disable the Solutions if
        Customer does not pay an invoice by the Due Date.

    4.  Taxes, Shipping, Title, & Risk of Loss. Customer will be
        responsible for all taxes (except for taxes on Strategic Defense
        Corporation’s income or real property), such as sales, use, or
        excise taxes, and similar charges of any kind imposed by any
        governmental entity for Solutions supplied under this Agreement.
        Customer is also responsible and will pay for freight, shipping,
        handling, insurance, and other transportation charges, inclusive
        of, but not limited to, all applicable import and export fees,

        loss of TPP is governed by the External Product Agreements.

4.  PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

        non-sublicensable, royalty-free permit to access and use the
        Solutions and Hardware during the term of the applicable Order
        Verification or SOW only. All technology and documentation used
        by Strategic Defense Corporation in connection with executing
        the Solutions, inclusive of, but not limited to, software
        solutions, portals, data handling systems (each of the
        foregoing, in object code and source code form), report
        templates, and Hardware, any associated Strategic Defense
        Corporation intellectual rights, and any derivative works or
        modifications (“Strategic Defense Corporation IP”), is the sole
        and exclusive property of, and is valuable, private, and
        proprietary to Strategic Defense Corporation. Customer will not

        Agreement conveys no right or permit to manufacture, duplicate,
        or otherwise copy or reproduce any of the Hardware. Customer
        will not remove any proprietary notices on Hardware delivered
        and may not co-brand or otherwise add any branding or marking to

        Strategic Defense Corporation’s sole and exclusive property.
        Subject to Customer’s acceptance of and adherence with
        applicable External Product Agreements, Strategic Defense
        Corporation will supply to Customer and the TPP vendor will
        grant to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        non-sublicensable permit for the Duration of the applicable
        Order Verification or SOW, to use TPP for Customer’s internal
        operations and maintenance purposes in accordance with this
        Agreement, and not for commercial distribution or other trade
        dealings.

        activities on Customer’s network, inclusive of, but not limited
        to, network configuration, TCP/IP packet headers and contents,
        log files, malicious codes, and Trojan horses. Customer grants
        to Strategic Defense Corporation a limited, non-exclusive permit
        to use such information during the Duration. During and after
        the Duration, Strategic Defense Corporation retains the right to
        use such information or aggregations for any reasonable purpose,
        supplied that it is anonymized and does not contain information
        identifying Customer. Additionally, Strategic Defense
        Corporation retains all rights to commercialize and release any
        material resulting from providing consulting and professional
        solutions if such material does not identify the Customer or
        include details of any vulnerabilities unique to the Customer's
        environment or systems.

    3.  Publicity, Trademarks and Logo. Without prior written approval
        signed by an authorized representative of Strategic Defense
        Corporation, Customer will not, directly or indirectly, (i) use
        Strategic Defense Corporation’s name or any of Strategic Defense
        Corporation’s trademarks, service marks or logos, (ii) make any
        public announcement related to this Agreement or the Solutions
        or (iii) disclose to any third party the fact that Strategic
        Defense Corporation is Customer’s service provider.

5.  CONFIDENTIALITY

    1.  Definitions. “Private Data” means any and all non-public,
        proprietary, or private information or documentation disclosed
        by either Participant (“Discloser”) to the other Participant
        (“Recipient”) inclusive of not limited to, documents, trade
        secrets, know-how, data centers, prototypes, samples, Hardware,
        software solutions, benchmark tests, specifications, trade
        secrets, object code and machine-readable copies, (inclusive of
        all copies and derivatives of it), regardless of format. Private
        Data will not, however, include any information which

        1.  was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or
            subsequent to when it was disclosed to the Recipient by no
            fault of Recipient,

        2.  is already rightfully in the possession of the Recipient at
            the time of disclosure, as the Recipient can demonstrate
            through objective time-stamped evidence, and free of any
            private obligation, or

        3.  is independently developed by the Recipient without use of
            or reference to the Discloser’s Private Data, or

        4.  is required by legislation to be disclosed by the Recipient,
            supplied that the Recipient gives the Discloser prompt
            written notice of such requirement prior to disclosure to
            the extent permitted by applicable legislation and
            assistance in obtaining a protective order. Recipient will
            limit any such required disclosure to the information
            explicitly requested.

    2.  Confidential Treatment. Recipient will not use any Private Data
        of the Discloser for any purpose other than as contemplated by
        this Agreement or any Order Verification or SOW. Recipient will
        not disclose any Private Data of the Discloser to third parties
        or to any employees, except to those employees who are required
        to have the information to evaluate or engage in discussions
        concerning the Solutions, or the terms of this Agreement or any
        applicable Order Verification or SOW. Neither Participant will
        reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile any prototypes,
        software solutions, or other tangible objects which embody the
        other Participant’s Private Data. Recipient will take
        commercially reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and
        avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Discloser’s Private
        Data.

    3.  Injunctive Relief. A Participant’s breach of its duties of
        privacy may cause the other Participant irreparable injury for
        which it would not have an adequate remedy at legislation. In
        the event of a breach, the non-breaching Participant will be
        entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other
        remedies it may have at legislation or in equity.

    4.  No Representations. Strategic Defense Corporation’s duties under
        this Section 5 do not create any additional implied or express
        representations or guarantees regarding the Solutions. Strategic
        Defense Corporation will not be responsible for any breach of
        this Agreement resulting from a hack or intrusion by a third
        party into Customer’s network, environment, software solutions,
        hardware, operational technology, or information technology
        systems, unless the hack or intrusion was through endpoints or
        devices monitored by Strategic Defense Corporation pursuant to
        an Order Verification or SOW and was caused directly by
        Strategic Defense Corporation’s gross negligence or willful
        misconduct.

6.  TERM AND TERMINATION

    1.  Duration. This Agreement will commence on the Commencement Date
        and will continue in full force and effect thereafter until

            of being cured, is not cured within thirty (30) days after

            Participant with written notice of such breach;

        2.  Strategic Defense Corporation may terminate this Agreement
            or any Service for cause, if the TPP used to provide such
            Solutions is substantially changed by the TPP provider
            (inclusive of a substantial increase in price), or if, for
            any reason, Strategic Defense Corporation no longer has
            access to or the ability to use such TPP;

        3.  Strategic Defense Corporation may terminate this Agreement
            or any applicable Service for cause if Customer fails to pay

            thirty (30) days after Strategic Defense Corporation gives
            Customer written notice of such nonpayment; and

        4.  Strategic Defense Corporation may terminate this Agreement
            or any applicable Service for cause if Customer

            1.  terminates or suspends its business,

            2.  becomes insolvent, admits in writing its inability to
                pay its debts as they mature, makes an assignment for
                the benefit of creditors, or becomes subject to direct
                control of a trustee, receiver, or similar authority, or

            3.  becomes subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency
                proceeding under federal or state statutes.

    4.  Hardware Return. Upon the earlier of the termination or
        expiration of the Agreement or the SOW or Order Verification,
        Customer will return all Hardware to Strategic Defense
        Corporation. If the Hardware is not timely returned or is not in
        the same condition as received by Customer (except for normal
        wear and tear), Customer will be responsible for the
        then-current replacement costs of such Hardware.

    5.  End of Life. If, during the term of the applicable SOW or Order
        Verification, Strategic Defense Corporation discontinues any
        Service, Strategic Defense Corporation will provide Customer
        with written notice of such discontinuation as soon as
        reasonably practicable but no less than ninety (90) days prior
        to such discontinuation and may, in its sole discretion,
        either (i) substitute the discontinued Service with a service of
        comparable quality and effectiveness, or (ii) terminate the
        discontinued Solutions.

    6.  Effect of Duration in action. If Customer terminates this
        Agreement or a Service, Customer agrees to pay Strategic Defense
        Corporation within thirty (30) days for all Solutions performed
        by Strategic Defense Corporation up to the date of cancellation
        that have not previously been paid. Additionally, if Customer
        terminates this Agreement or any Service other than for cause,
        then Customer will pay Strategic Defense Corporation, as a
        cancellation fee and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the
        sum of the Charges for the remainder of the term of the
        applicable Service(s). The rights and duties in Sections 3
        through 7 and Section 9 will survive any termination or

        solely responsible for all costs associated with repairing or
        replacing any Hardware damaged by or as a result of

        1.  an accident,

        2.  unusual physical, electrical, or electromagnetic stress,

            wishes to identify a Dispute, it will provide written notice
            to the other Participant, detailing the nature of such a
            Dispute. The Parties will negotiate in good faith and
            resolve any Dispute.

        2.  Arbitration. If the Parties cannot resolve a Dispute under
            the above Section within thirty (30) days of notice of a
            Dispute, any such Dispute will be settled by private
            arbitration process to be held in Chicago, Illinois, in
            accordance with the rules then in effect of the American
            Arbitration Association. The Parties agree to a panel made
            up of one arbitrator in the event of a Dispute. The
            arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief. The
            decision of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive, and
            binding on the Parties. Judgment may be entered on the
            arbitrator's decision in any court having jurisdiction over

            content or result of any arbitration process held relating
            to this Agreement without the prior written consent of both
            Parties.

        3.  Venue and Jury Waiver. If the Parties cannot resolve a
            Dispute under Section 11.12.1 and a final decision is not
            reached or available under Section 11.12.2, or, if for any
            reason a Dispute must proceed in court as a legislation
            suit: (1) any such Dispute will only be brought as a
            legislation suit in the District Court for the Northern
            District of Illinois, Eastern Division or, if the District
            Court for the Northern Division of Illinois, Eastern
            Division does not have subject matter jurisdiction, then in
            a court of competent jurisdiction in Cook County,
            Illinois, (2) both Parties irrevocably consent and submit to
            the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such
            courts, (3) BOTH PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY,
            AND (4) ANY ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
            AND NEITHER PARTY MAY JOIN IN AN ACTION OR ARBITRATION AS A
            REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS. Notwithstanding any
            provision in this Agreement, no Participant will bring any
            claim, demand, action, legislation suit, or arbitration
            process based on this Agreement if either (i) the applicable
            statute of limitations has expired, or (ii) eighteen (18)
            months has elapsed after the date the Participant discovered
            or reasonably should have discovered (inclusive of
            constructive discovery) such claim, whichever comes first.

    13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
        counterparts, each of which will constitute a duplicate
        original, but all counterparts together will constitute a single
        contract.

    14. Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement constitutes the
        entire contract between the Parties and supersedes all prior or
        contemporaneous contracts, proposals, understandings, and
        communications, both written and oral. The DPA and any end-user
        permit contract or other terms supplied to Customer during the
        course of business are incorporated into and made part of this
        Agreement by reference. This Agreement may only be modified or
        amended in writing and signed by both Parties. In the event of a
        conflict between this Agreement and an Order Verification or
        SOW, the terms of this Agreement govern unless specifically
        agreed in writing between the Parties. If there are any changes
        or updates to applicable legislations, rules, rules, standards,
        interpretations, or other external guidelines, Strategic Defense

        Section 11.11 is amended in its entirety as follows: 11.11
        Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed
        by and construed in accordance with the legislations of the

        of legislation principles. Each Participant irrevocably submits
        to the non-sole jurisdiction of courts exercising jurisdiction
        in New South Wales and courts of appeal from them in respect of
        any proceedings arising out of or in connection with this
        Agreement. Each Participant irrevocably waives any right it has
        to object to the venue of any legal process in the courts
        described in this clause on the basis that: any proceeding
        arising out of or in connection with this Agreement has been
        brought in an inconvenient forum; or the courts described in
        this clause do not have jurisdiction. 5. Section 11.12 is
        amended in its entirety as follows: 11.12 Dispute Resolution.
        “Dispute” means any conflict or controversy arising out of or
        relating to any interpretation, construction, performance, or
        breach of this Agreement, any Order Verification, or any SOW.
        13.12.1 Inter-Participant Dispute Settlement. If a Participant
        wishes to identify a Dispute, it will provide written notice to
        the other Participant, detailing the nature of such a Dispute.
        The Parties will negotiate in good faith and resolve any
        Dispute.

    5.  Mediation. If the Parties cannot resolve a Dispute under Section
        11.12.1 within thirty (30) days of notice of a Dispute, the
        Parties must participate in mediation process in accordance with
        this section. Neither Participant may commence court or
        arbitration process proceedings arising from or relating to the
        Dispute, other than a claim for urgent interlocutory relief,
        unless that Participant has participated in a mediation process
        in accordance with this section. Compliance with this section is
        a condition precedent to the right of any Participant to
        commence litigation or arbitration process arising from, or in
        connection with, the Dispute. The Parties will agree a mediator
        within fourteen (14) days of either Participant giving the other
        Participant written notice of its intention to invoke mediation
        process. If the Parties cannot agree on a mediator, then the
        Dispute will be referred to the Australian Disputes Centre
        (“ADC”). All mediation process proceedings will be conducted in
        accordance with the ADC Mediation Guidelines. The mediation
        process will take place at a place suitable for both parties.
        The Parties will pay the mediator fees equally and each pay
        their own counsel fees and expenses. The existence, content or
        result of any mediation process and any information, material or
        documentation produced, exchanged, or used in any way during the
        mediation process will be designated as private.

    6.  Limitation of Claims and Jury Waiver. If the Parties cannot
        resolve a Dispute under 12 Section 11.12.1 and a settlement is
        not reached or available under Section 11.12.2, or, if for any
        reason a Dispute proceeds in court as a legislation suit: (1)
        BOTH PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY, AND (2) ANY
        ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NEITHER PARTY
        MAY JOIN IN AN ACTION OR ARBITRATION AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR
        MEMBER OF A CLASS. Notwithstanding any provision in this
        Agreement, no Participant will bring any claim, demand, action,
        legislation suit, or arbitration process based on this Agreement
        if either (i) the applicable statute of limitations has expired
        or (ii) eighteen (18) months has elapsed after the date the
        Participant discovered or reasonably should have discovered
        (inclusive of constructive discovery) such claim, whichever
        comes first.
