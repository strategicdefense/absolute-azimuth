Application Security Testing. Guided by OWASP, layered with manual testing, designed to find gremlins.

## Objective:
Web Application Penetration Testing aims to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within web applications to assess their security posture. This type of testing scrutinizes various components of web applications, including their source code, database management systems, and back-end network connections. The goal is to uncover vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers to compromise user data, gain unauthorized access, or perform other malicious activities.

## Methodology:
The methodology for web application penetration testing encompasses a wide array of testing techniques and practices designed to probe for vulnerabilities across different layers of a web application. It involves both automated scanning and manual testing techniques to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the application's security. Features include:

- **OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities Testing:** Focused examination of the web application for vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10, which includes injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, XML External Entities (XXE), broken access control, security misconfigurations, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Insecure Deserialization, using components with known vulnerabilities, and insufficient logging and monitoring.
Authentication and Session Management: Testing the security of user authentication and session management mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and session hijacking.

- **Input Validation:** Identifying vulnerabilities that arise from improper validation of user inputs, such as SQL Injection, XSS, and other injection flaws, which can allow attackers to manipulate the application or access underlying databases.

- **Business Logic Flaws:** Examining the application for business logic vulnerabilities that could be exploited to circumvent application flows or conduct unauthorized activities.

- **Configuration and Deployment Security:** Assessing the application's deployment environment for misconfigurations, outdated components, and insecure default settings that could pose security risks.

- **Data Encryption:** Evaluating the implementation of encryption for sensitive data both in transit (such as HTTPS) and at rest, to protect against data breaches and interception.

- **Error Handling and Logging:** Reviewing how the application handles errors and logs events to ensure that sensitive information is not disclosed and that adequate logging is in place for incident detection and response.

This methodology not only identifies vulnerabilities but also assesses the potential impact of exploiting them, providing a realistic view of the risks to the web application. By simulating the actions of real-world attackers, web application penetration testing offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of the application's security controls and the areas where improvements are needed.

## Scoping Parameters:
Scoping for web application penetration testing involves defining the boundaries of the test, including the specific applications and their components to be assessed. The scope should clearly outline the objectives of the testing, any areas or functionalities that are off-limits, and a timeline for conducting the testing activities.

## Engagement Scale and Duration:
The scale and duration of a web application penetration test can vary based on the complexity of the application, the extent of the functionalities to be tested, and the depth of the testing required. Engagements can range from a focused assessment of a single application to comprehensive testing of multiple applications across an organization's portfolio.

> Note: For applications with extensive functionalities or those integrated with complex backend systems, custom scoping is essential to define precise testing parameters and ensure a thorough evaluation of the web application's security posture.
