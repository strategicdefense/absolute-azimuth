# Expert CMMC Consulting: Achieve Compliance & Secure DOD Contracts

## CCA-Certified Guidance for the Defense Industrial Base

### Navigate CMMC with Confidence

The **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)** presents a critical compliance challenge for organizations within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). 
Failure to meet these evolving Department of Defense (DoD) requirements can jeopardize your ability to win and maintain vital contracts. Strategic Defense provides 
expert, CCA-certified CMMC consulting services designed to guide your organization through every step of the compliance journey.

Leveraging decades of deep experience with NIST standards and DoD cybersecurity requirements, our team, which includes Certified CMMC Assessors (CCAs), 
demystifies the complexities of CMMC. We translate intricate regulations into actionable strategies, ensuring you implement effective, sustainable security practices.

### Understanding the CMMC Landscape

CMMC builds upon foundational requirements like DFARS clause 252.204-7012, which mandated the implementation of NIST SP 800-171 controls for protecting 
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The CMMC framework, formalized through regulations like DFARS clause 252.204-7021 and the CMMC Final Rule 
(effective late 2024/early 2025 with phased implementation), introduces mandatory assessment requirements for DIB contractors. Depending on the information you handle, 
your organization will need to meet specific CMMC levels:

* **CMMC Level 1 (Foundational Hygiene):**
    * Applies to organizations handling Federal Contract Information (FCI) only.
    * Requires implementation of 15 specific controls derived from NIST SP 800-171.
    * Allows for annual self-assessment and affirmation by senior leadership.
    * **Note:** False attestations carry significant risk under the False Claims Act, potentially leading to severe penalties for both the company and 
individuals.

* **CMMC Level 2 (Advanced Hygiene):**
    * Applies to organizations handling CUI.
    * Requires full implementation and documentation of all 110 controls outlined in NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2.
    * Mandates triennial assessments conducted by accredited Certified 3rd Party Assessment Organizations (C3PAOs). These assessments are performed by highly 
qualified CCAs who undergo rigorous training, examination, background checks, and possess verified cybersecurity experience.

* **CMMC Level 3 (Expert Hygiene):**
    * Applies to organizations handling CUI associated with the highest priority DoD programs.
    * Requires implementation of all 110 controls from NIST SP 800-171 plus additional controls from NIST SP 800-172.
    * Mandates triennial government-led assessments by the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC).
