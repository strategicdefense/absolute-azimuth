## Objective:
Wireless Penetration Tests are intricately designed to evaluate the security posture of an organization's wireless network infrastructure. These tests aim to identify vulnerabilities in wireless protocols, authentication mechanisms, and network segmentation. The critical distinction of these tests lies in their focus on exploiting weaknesses within wireless network configurations and the encryption mechanisms in use, rather than the wired network perimeter defenses.

## Scope and Methodology:
The assessment begins with the identification and mapping of all wireless access points within the organization's premises, including but not limited to employee-accessible networks, guest networks, and hidden or non-broadcast networks. The process involves analyzing the implementation of wireless security protocols (e.g., WPA2, WPA3), the strength of encryption used, and the resilience of the network to various attack vectors such as Evil Twin attacks, Rogue Access Point deployments, and encryption cracking techniques.

The methodology encompasses a comprehensive review of the wireless network’s ability to segregate sensitive information and resist unauthorized access. Testers employ a variety of techniques to attempt to breach these networks, including but not limited to penetration testing from the perspective of an unauthorized user with no credentials, to an insider with limited access rights. The goal is to assess the network's susceptibility to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the network's access controls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.

## Scoping Parameters:
Scoping for wireless penetration testing involves defining the boundaries of the wireless network’s coverage area and identifying all active wireless networks associated with the organization. The scoping process should aim to include a diverse array of wireless environments, such as corporate offices, remote locations, and any third-party operated wireless networks within the organizational ecosystem.

The objectives of the engagement should be clearly outlined, focusing on specific concerns such as the ability of an external attacker to gain unauthorized access to the network, the potential for data interception during wireless communication, and the integrity of the network's device authentication and authorization mechanisms.
