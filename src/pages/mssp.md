## Partner with Us for a One-Two Punch! 

We understand the pivotal role Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) play in shaping todayâ€™s cyber landscape. We know, because we've spend decades building 
high-performing penetration testing services specifically for the largest MSSPs around. That's why we're committed to empowering you with top-of-the-heap, goal-based 
penetration testing services that round out your portfolio and set you apart from the competition. From phishing, to appsec, to Ransomware Simulations, to Red Teaming and 
beyond; Here's why forming a partnership with us is your next strategic move: 

## Exclusive Focus on Penetration Testing 

You help guard the hen house, let us play fox and do what we do best: premium penetration testing focused on the real-world risk that matters. Our dedication means you're 
partnering with specialists who don't offer competing services but instead enhance your portfolio, allowing you to stand out in the market. Offense and Defense go together 
in a beautiful one-two punch of posture strengthening. 

## Quality That Outshines the Rest 

We pride ourselves on delivering more than just penetration testing; we provide a white-glove partnership that elates your customers and helps boost your service 
offerings. Not to mention, our team regularly gets Net Promoter Scores higher than Amazon and Netflix. Our methodology is rigorous (based on 
[PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page)), our testers are the best in the industry, and our insights are real. This combination ensures that when you 
partner with us, you're offering a level of service that's unmatched by any other provider. Our commitment to excellence helps reinforce your reputation as a leader in 
cybersecurity. 

Most other vendors perform a vulnerability scan and provide that as a "penetration test". Not here, all we do is goal-based testing designed to emulate what the real-world 
bad guys do. This means reports are hand-written and include ways we actually breached the environment - not theoretical fluff churned out by scanners and automation. 

## Boost Customer Retention

Effective cybersecurity is not just about prevention; it's about building a culture of security. Our services do more than just uncover vulnerabilities; they educate and 
empower your clients towards better security practices. This not only helps in safeguarding their business but also in fostering trust in your services. By showing your 
commitment to their security through our technical, comprehensive reports and actionable insights, you're not just protecting their assets; you're investing in their peace 
of mind. This trust is invaluable for customer retention and loyalty.
