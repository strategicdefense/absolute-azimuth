### The Mass Exploitation Playbook: Lessons from the 81,000 Hacked Firewalls

Recently, a Chinese hacker was charged with exploiting 81,000 firewalls across the globe, according to [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/us-charges-chinese-hacker-for.html). This staggering number highlights a critical 
misconception about how businesses are targeted in cyberattacks. It’s not about a hacker meticulously plotting against a specific organization; rather, it’s about casting a wide net to indiscriminately exploit vulnerable systems. Only after 
gaining access do hackers decide whether the organization behind the system is worth further targeting.

#### How Businesses Are Really Targeted

The traditional idea of hackers carefully selecting a target before launching an attack is outdated. Today’s cybercriminals use automated tools to scan the entire Internet for vulnerabilities. Tools like **Masscan**, capable of scanning the 
whole Internet for specific services in minutes, and **Shodan**, a search engine for discovering Internet-connected devices, make this process incredibly efficient. The approach is broad and indiscriminate—hackers are simply looking for any 
vulnerable system to exploit.

Once these vulnerabilities are exploited, hackers often investigate the compromised systems to identify their owners. By this point, it’s often too late to prevent significant damage. Additionally, threat actors frequently sell access to 
compromised systems on the dark web, often naming the companies they’ve breached. This commoditization of exploits makes the situation even more dangerous, increasing the likelihood of further targeted attacks and data breaches.

#### The Anatomy of the Attack

In this case, the hacker exploited a vulnerability in specific firewall devices. Firewalls play a critical role in protecting networks from unauthorized traffic, but outdated or misconfigured firewalls can become easy entry points for 
attackers.

By compromising 81,000 firewalls, the attacker demonstrated that their goal was mass exploitation rather than targeting specific organizations. This mass compromise granted access to the internal networks of numerous businesses. Such attacks 
are particularly dangerous as they not only compromise the integrity of affected systems but also open the door for further exploitation, including data theft and ransomware attacks.

#### Lessons for Businesses

This incident underscores the need for a proactive approach to cybersecurity. If your systems are connected to the Internet, they’re part of the pool of potential targets. The scale of this attack shows that no business—regardless of size or 
industry—is immune.

Here’s how to protect your organization:

1. **Patch and Vulnerability Management:** Regularly update all devices and software, especially those exposed to the Internet. Outdated systems are prime targets for attackers. Use the [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities 
Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) to prioritize patches for actively exploited vulnerabilities.
2. **Configuration Reviews:** Ensure firewalls, routers, and other critical devices are properly configured and not exposing unnecessary ports or services.
3. **Regular Penetration Testing:** Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities before hackers do. This approach provides a clear roadmap for improving your security. Learn more about how we can help on our [Network Penetration 
Testing Services page](https://strategicdefense.co/services/network).

#### Don’t Wait to Be a Statistic

Hackers are constantly scanning for vulnerabilities. Ensuring your systems are secure is one of the best ways to protect your business from being exploited. Don’t wait for an attack to happen—take action now to safeguard your network. Contact
